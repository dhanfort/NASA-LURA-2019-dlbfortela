# This LURA project was conducted at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette
# Department of Chemical Engineering: https://chemical.louisiana.edu/
#
# The R-scripts must be executed in the R-statistical software, an open-source computing software
# R installer may be downloaded from the R-project website: https://www.r-project.org/
# We executed R via RStudio, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R
# RStudio may be downloaded for free from RStudio website: https://rstudio.com/
# We suggest the user to run R via RStudio for more organized workflow
