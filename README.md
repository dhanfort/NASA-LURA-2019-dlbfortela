# NASA-LURA-2019-dlbfortela

----------------------------------------------------------------
 This GitHub repository contains the R-scripts coded by 
 Alyssa DeLattre (apprentice student, Chemical Enigneering) and Dr. Dhan Lord B. Fortela (faculty-mentor; Principal Investigator (PI); Chemical Engineering)
 for the LURA 2019-2020 Project sponsored by the Louisiana Space Grant Consortium (LaSPACE): https://laspace.lsu.edu/about-us/.
 LSU Sub-award No.: PO-0000105697;
 Primary NASA Agreement No.: NNX15AH82H.


 The R-scripts must be executed in the R-statistical software, an open-source computing software.
 The R installer may be downloaded from the R-project website: https://www.r-project.org/.
 We executed R via RStudio, which is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R.
 RStudio may be downloaded for-free from RStudio website: https://rstudio.com/.
 We suggest the user to run R via RStudio for more organized workflow.

 This LURA project was conducted at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette,
 Department of Chemical Engineering: https://chemical.louisiana.edu/. For future project collaborations contact Dr. Fortela at dhanlord.fortela@louisiana.edu. This repository is maintained by the PI.
 We are grateful to LaSPACE and NASA for funding this research project.
 Go LaSPACE! Go NASA!
